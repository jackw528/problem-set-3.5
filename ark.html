   <h2><strong>Info</strong></h2>
   <p>Ark: Survival Evolved was released as a full game on PC, Mac, PS4, and Xbox on August 29, 2017 and released later on more platforms. A main feature of Ark is that it is in prehistoric times and the animals reflect that. The game includes over 80 creatures spread throughout the land, air, and sea. You are able to tame many of these creatures to assist you with travel, carrying items, or whatever you need. There are also different phases to the game. You start out in the stone phase, using stone tools and having a stone base. Then, after playing for a while, you move into the metal phase, using metal tools and armor, and having a base made out of metal. Finally, the end game phase is the tek(purposely misspelled) phase. This phase is the most difficult to reach and takes a very long time to do so. However, once you do achieve the tek phase you can rule the map with highly advanced weapons, armor, and bases. Ark not only has several vast and interesting maps for you to play on, you can also play on a procedurally generated map, meaning that the landscape is random and different than every other map. The maps' original release dates in chronological order are:</p>

      <li>The Island - June, 2015(Original map)</li>
       <li>The Center - May, 2016(Free DLC, released during early access)</li>

   <h2><strong>My Opinion</strong></h2>
     <p>Rating: 7.5/10</p>
     <h3>Positives</h3>
       <p>I am a big fan of this game and have followed it since its original release on PC in June, 2015. At that time, I only owned an Xbox so I was forced to wait until December, 2015 until it released on Xbox. However, it was worth the wait. I enjoyed playing the game on a private and public servers. The building system is easy to use. but expansive. Progressing did not take too long, I first reached the metal phase in a day or two. my favorite part of the game was playing with my friends and taming different dinosaurs and battling with them.</p>
     <h3>Negatives</h3>
       <p>The game currently has many bugs, such as glitching through the ground, resulting in losing the items you're carrying, and instead of fixing them, Wildcard(the studio that made Ark) continues to make DLCs. Paid DLCs are annoying as well, but I wouldn't mind paying for more of this game if it worked. A game mechanic that I dislike is the taming time. There are options to make it faster, and I use them, but in public servers and private servers with normal settings, taming can take several hours. The time goes up with the level of the creature you're taming. For example, I was taming a level 110 Megalodon and it took over ten hours, all of which I needed to be in the game.</p>

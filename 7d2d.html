   <h2><strong>Info</strong></h2>
     <p>7 Days to Die was originally released on December 13, 2013 and is now in Alpha 16.4, with Alpha 17 on the way. Each update continues to add new points of interest(POIs), zombie types, loot, and more. The main premise of the game is that you wake up, in the middle of the zombie apocalypse, and you have to gather resources, get items from cities and POIs, and build something that can survive the horde that comes every seven days. Don't forget to have some shelter every night because from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM, the zombies are faster and stronger than during the day. There are 8 different biomes to explore in the randomly generated maps:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Desert</li>
      <li>Plains</li>
      <li>Forest</li>
      <li>Pine Forest</li>
      <li>Snowy Forest</li>
      <li>Burnt Forest</li>
      <li>Wasteland</li>
      <li>Nuclear Fallout Zone</li>
     </ul>

   <h2><strong>My Opinion</strong></h2>
     <p>Rating: 8.5/10</p>
   <h3>Positives</h3>
     <p>I have played this game on Xbox, solo and with friends. I also plan to buy it on PC soon. I enjoyed both singleplayer and multiplayer, exploring, looting, preparing for hordes, etc. My favorite part was building a base because I can build a base to be defendable and aesthetically pleasing, while also being creative with the design. Also, the game is still in development so if you don't like something or want to add something, you can <a href="http://thefunpimps.com/contact/">suggest it to the developers<a>.</p>
   <h3>Negatives</h3>
     <p>While it is a main pillar of the game, the hordes are also a negative, in my opinion. As an inexperienced player, I did not know how to prepare for a horde, nor what I should be working towards. While this lack of knowledge is common at first in most games, in 7D2D, the hordes get progressively more difficult and not knowing what to do will result in you not being able to continue and having to restart.</p>
